# Templates Folder

This folder contains template images used for image matching.

## Reset Button Template

Place a screenshot of the Reset button in this folder as `reset_button`.

The template image should be a clear, cropped image of just the Reset button (without surrounding UI elements).

To create the template:
1. Take a screenshot of the game window when the Potential window is open
2. Crop the image to include only the Reset button
3. Save it as `reset_button` in this folder
